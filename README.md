#### Organization
The purpose of this repository is to provide evidence, to those interested, of my coding abilities in my various projects at UC Berkeley as an undergraduate. All my projects are organized in folders. Class related projects are labelled with "class" at the end and research projects are labelled with "research" at the end

All class projects only have two files. One for the report and one for the code that generated the report. For my R_class because there were two projects, there are four files for that folder.

Research Projects are organized differently and will be elaborated more in a README file in the folders themselves.
1) Hurricane Research will only have a code folder because the paper has only been submitted and is currently under review while the conference is expected to happen next year also.

2) The Radiobiology Research will have three main folders. One for conference related documents, one for the GCRFibroCA project that was part of my first research project, and another folder labelled Identifiability Analysis for my most recent self initiated project for a planned submission to JASA.

Those who want to see my most recent work is advised to look at my Hurricane Research and my Identifiability Research.

Note: Because much of my research is currently ongoing and thus I cannot publicly distribute my paper, those who are interested in seeing my current work, which include my work I plan to submit to JASA or my submitted hurricane research work (currently under review) to ScientificReports Journal, please send me a personal email at daewoongham@berkeley.edu
