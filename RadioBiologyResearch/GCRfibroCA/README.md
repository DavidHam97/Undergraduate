THE GCRfibroCA is referring to my first research project with Professor Sachs that resulted in my first authored paper.

This folder will contain two folder. 

1) Paper: Containing the actual paper that is published along with the supplement

2) Code: The code is organized with the main_script containing the main flow chart for all parts of the code sourcing functions
from the other two folder main_helper and supplementary_helper. The distinction between these two folders is that main_helper
contains the helper functions for the main script and the supplementary_helper contains the functions for the supplementary section.

Note: In order to run this properly please make sure all path is correctly defined
