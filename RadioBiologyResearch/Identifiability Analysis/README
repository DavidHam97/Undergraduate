Identifiability Analysis project is referring to my most reject project with a planned submission to JASA

This folder will only contain the code folder because the paper is still in progress.

1) Code Folder: The code is organized with the main_script containing the main flow chart for all parts of the code sourcing functions
from the other two folder main_helper and supplementary_helper. The distinction between these two folders is that main_helper
contains the helper functions for the main script and the supplementary_helper contains the functions for the supplementary section.

Note: In order to run this properly please make sure all path is correctly defined
