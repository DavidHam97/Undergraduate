This research's code folder will contain two main parts

1) Main_Script.R: This is the main script which is a simple flow chart to source other helper functions all located in the folder called "Helper Functions"
The main script will contain brief information for every major part of the coding project.

2) Helper Function Folder: In the Helper Function will be much longer scripts containing the code for each part that was mentioned in the main script.

Because this research relied on outside datasets and other computationally expensive api's I have also attached a raw_data folder for our results to be reproducible
This is located in a folder called "rawdata"
